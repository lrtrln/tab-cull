# 🧐 Tab Triage Dashboard

A Firefox extension for managing and triaging your tabs with sorting, filtering, grouping, and bulk actions.

## Features

- **Multi-column sorting** — click columns to add sort layers (desc → asc → off), with priority indicators
- **Checkbox filters** — combine multiple age buckets (OR) and status filters (AND)
- **Domain multi-select** — searchable dropdown with checkboxes, select all/none
- **Grouping** — by domain, window, age bucket, status, or duplicates — collapsible groups sorted by count
- **Search** — debounced search across title, URL, and domain (Escape to clear)
- **Configurable favicon size** — slider from 16px to 48px, persisted across sessions
- **Actions per tab:**
  - **Go** — switch to the tab
  - **Dedup** — close all other tabs with the same URL, keep this one
  - **Ignore** — hide tabs by URL or entire domain (persisted, manageable)
  - **Close** — close the tab
- **Ignore management** — toggle to show ignored tabs only, panel to review/remove ignores, reset all
- **Color coding** — stale tabs (30d+ orange, 90d+ red), high domain count (5+ orange, 20+ red), duplicate rows highlighted
- **Catppuccin Macchiato** dark theme

## Install

Install from [Firefox Add-ons (AMO)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-triage-dashboard/).

### Manual install

1. Download the latest `.zip` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. In Firefox: `about:addons` → gear icon → **Install Add-on From File** → select the `.zip`

## Usage

Filter and sort the tab list, then use **Select all filtered tabs** (or the checkbox in the table header) and **Close selected** to close the result in one batch. You can also select individual rows and clear the selection. Collapsed groups are included; dashboard tabs are excluded. Changing filters removes hidden tabs from the selection.

Use **Export selected links** to save the selection, or **Export all links** to save all open tabs regardless of filters and ignore lists. Exports are plain text files with one URL per line in the current sort order, preserving duplicate URLs. Dashboard tabs and empty URLs are excluded. To export a filtered result, select all filtered tabs and export the selection.

Click the 🧐 icon in the toolbar to open the triage dashboard.
